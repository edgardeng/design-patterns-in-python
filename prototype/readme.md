## 原型（Prototype）
> 通过“复制”一个已经存在的实例来返回新的实例,而不是新建实例。被复制的实例就是我们所称的“原型”，这个原型是可定制的。

Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows cloning objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes.

All prototype classes should have a common interface that makes it possible to copy objects even if their concrete classes are unknown. Prototype objects can produce full copies since objects of the same class can access each other’s private fields.
