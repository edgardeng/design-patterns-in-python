## 工厂方法（Factory Method）
定义一个创建对象的接口，但让实现这个接口的类来决定实例化哪个类。工厂方法让类的实例化推迟到子类中进行。

Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of direct constructor call (new operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created.
