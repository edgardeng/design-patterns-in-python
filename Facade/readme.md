Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.

Usage examples: The Facade pattern is commonly used in apps written in Python. It’s especially handy when working with complex libraries and APIs.

Identification: Facade can be recognized in a class that has a simple interface, but delegates most of the work to other classes. Usually, facades manage the full life cycle of objects they use.

外观模式为子系统中的一组接口提供一个统一的高层接口，使得子系统更容易使用。
