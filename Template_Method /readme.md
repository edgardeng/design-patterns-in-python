## Template Method （模板方法）
>> Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to defines a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and let subclasses override the steps without changing the overall algorithm’s structure.

Usage examples: The Template Method pattern is quite common in Python frameworks. Developers often use it to provide framework users with a simple means of extending standard functionality using inheritance.

Identification: Template Method can be recognized by behavioral methods that already have a “default” behavior defined by the base class.
