## Creational Patterns

| |Creational Patterns|||
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|![](./img/abstract-factory-mini.png) |Abstract Factory|Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.|[code](./abstract_factory/index.py)|
|![](img/builder-mini.png) |Builder |Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.|[code](./builder/index.py)|
|![](img/factory-method-mini.png) |Factory Method |Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created|[code](./factory/index.py)
|![](img/prototype-mini.png) |Prototype|Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.|[code](./prototype/index.py)|
|![](img/singleton-mini.png) |Singleton|Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.|[code](./singleton/index.py)|
