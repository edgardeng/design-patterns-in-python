Bridge is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or huge class into separate class hierarchies that can be developed independently.

Usage examples: The Bridge pattern is especially useful when dealing with cross-platform apps, supporting multiple types of database servers or working with several API providers of a certain kind (for example, cloud platforms, social networks, etc.)

Identification: Bridge can be recognized by a clear distinction between some controlling entity and several different platforms that it relies on.

桥接模式将抽象部分与实现部分分离，使它们都可以独立的变化。
